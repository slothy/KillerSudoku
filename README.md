# KillerSudoku

## About
This project aims to help beginners and advanced users alike when they become stuck on a Killer Sudoku puzzle.

## How It Works
You simply begin by starting to fill in the cells as you would normally do, and when you become stuck, click on the 'Gimme A Hint!' button, which will then run through a series of strategies and if it can calculate the next cell for you, it will place it on the board and explain to you how it got there. You are also able to view what the possible candidates are for each cell at any time.

## Installation (For Now)
